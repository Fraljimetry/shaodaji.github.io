# MathReader Regression Record — v334 regression + v335 targeted round-trip fix

Date: 2026-11-02 (America/Los_Angeles)

## v335 targeted export/import fix

This package keeps the full v334 regression campaign below and adds one targeted portability fix discovered immediately afterward. No new broad regression corpus is claimed for v335.

Confirmed bug: an image/scanned PDF could be fully OCRed, detected, and exported, but importing that reading-data JSON on a clean browser did **not** carry the full-document OCR cache or the automatic equation index. If the matching PDF was then opened without rerunning OCR, MathReader could enter the text-unavailable path and clear the imported text-derived indexes, leaving no Structure/Results/Equations/Bibliography.

v335 changes the export/import contract additively while retaining `mathreader.reading-data@1` compatibility:

- export now contains an explicit `contentDetection` snapshot: Structure (`inferredOutline`), Results, Equations, and Bibliography;
- export now contains `documentOcr` when full-document OCR is active and complete, including page text/geometry needed by search and downstream detectors;
- automatic equation detections are persisted as an equation-index snapshot instead of only a count;
- first-screen import writes the OCR snapshot under the exact SHA-256 document id before the user selects the matching PDF, so `loadCachedDocumentOcr()` restores it before the text-availability gate;
- import into an already-open matching PDF activates and persists the imported OCR cache before restoring the content-detection session.

Targeted validation performed for v335:

- synthetic equation-index round trip: 2 automatic equation rows exported and restored with page/ratio/confidence/OCR flags intact;
- synthetic 2-page full-document OCR snapshot accepted and restored only when page count matches; mismatched page-count OCR is rejected;
- synthetic portable content-detection snapshot restores Structure, Results, Equations, and Bibliography together;
- all JavaScript files pass `node --check`;
- source inspection confirms blank-screen import persists OCR before the matching PDF is opened, and open-document import activates OCR before `loadDocumentState()`.

Manual-browser caveat: this sandbox cannot fully exercise the browser file-picker/download + IndexedDB round trip with production OCR engines. The serialization/restoration contract and pure round-trip helpers are tested, but one real browser export → fresh import → select matching scanned PDF should remain a release smoke test.


## Regression rules

- Every regression uses genuinely new/newly rotated files plus a selective subset of older difficult fixtures.
- New coverage must span different branches of mathematics and adjacent technical fields. Geometric analysis is a minority/control slice unless the active bug requires it.
- Prefer pre-21st-century, archaic, degraded, scan-backed material when runnable files are available; modern/arXiv files are minority controls.
- Standard readable files receive strict visible-page checks for Structure/Results, Equations, and Bibliography. Missing items and false positives are release blockers.
- Illegible/corrupted/pathological files may use relaxed acceptance and must not drive code changes unless the behavior is a reproducible class problem or violates a general invariant.
- Every regression includes image/OCR coverage and selectively includes handwritten mathematics. OCR accuracy, downstream detection stability, and performance are checked.
- Equation and bibliography detection receive special scrutiny.
- Code changes are made only for class-level defects, never for a single-file exception.
- Regression is bounded to avoid timeout. Byte-identical cached OCR geometry may be reused for a difficult old fixture only when the current detector is rerun against it.
- Potential exceptions, uncertain side effects, and anything requiring manual browser/Texify verification are recorded below.

## Files covered

### New / newly rotated broad-field corpus

| File | Field / type | v334 acceptance result |
|---|---|---|
| `rose_tile_solution.pdf` | combinatorics / permutations / Burnside counting, Chinese | **0 Equations / 0 Results / 0 Bibliography.** All displayed formulas are intentionally unnumbered; no false equation labels. |
| `124ws2.pdf` | elementary calculus / graph interpretation / rates | **0 / 0 / 0.** Worksheet item numbers and graph tick values do not pollute Equations or Results. |
| `A_Geometric_Approach_to_Integration.pdf` | multivariable calculus / integration / Jacobian and measure intuition | **0 / 0 / 0.** Displayed formulas are unnumbered; section numbers are not equations. |
| `Where_do_Complex_Numbers_come_from_.pdf` | abstract algebra / complex-number construction | **0 Equations / 4 Results / 0 Bibliography.** The four explicit Definitions are correctly indexed; prose and algebraic expressions are not equations. |
| `14922fe9-aa1a-4a9c-8698-ee3ff46b703d.pdf` | engineering mechanics / helix geometry / Chinese technical note | **2 Equations / 0 Results / 0 Bibliography**, the two visibly displayed quoted formulas `(20)` and `(6)`. The hand-drawn figure page does not pollute detection. |

### Selectively retested older / difficult controls

| File | Field / era | v334 result |
|---|---|---|
| `Gromov_1967_A_Geometrical_Conjecture_of_Banach.pdf` | functional analysis / Banach-space geometry, 1967 | Native detector **15 / 14 / 9**; established strict image-assisted golden remains **16 / 14 / 9**, with visible `(10)` supplied only by image evidence. The v334 measurement guard does not affect this family. |

## Confirmed class-level defect fixed in v334

### Decimal measurements could become bare hierarchical equation labels

Technical documents often contain rows such as:

- `1.242 s / 22.8% faster`
- `1.40 GiB/s`
- `13.79 MiB/s`
- `31.6% faster`

The mature old-PDF detector deliberately allows a bare dotted token such as `1.14` when PDF extraction loses visible parentheses around an old equation number. In a performance table, that same recovery path could interpret the leading decimal `1.242` as equation `(1.242)` if its geometry happened to resemble an equation-number margin.

This is a repeated class, not a one-off glyph: `Fraljiculator_ArrayPool_Architecture_Updated.pdf` contains **33** decimal measurement rows using seconds, percentages, MiB/GiB and throughput units. Only one happened to pass all v333 geometry gates, demonstrating the instability.

v334 adds a narrow invariant: a **bare** dotted numeric candidate at line start is rejected when the immediately following token is an explicit measurement unit (`s`, `ms`, byte units, Hz-family, fps, `%`, etc.). Parenthesized labels and ordinary bare old-journal labels remain unchanged. The same guard applies to the two-column supplement path.

Regression effect:

- `Fraljiculator_ArrayPool_Architecture_Updated.pdf`: Equations **1 → 0**, removing only false `(1.242)`.
- Across every other file in this campaign, equation labels, Results, and Bibliography are **bit-for-bit identical at the detector-output level** to v333.

## OCR accuracy and performance

- `581 Note 7.pdf`: 3 image/handwritten pages, full-document local OCR proxy **2.06 s total / 0.69 s per page**. Downstream output **0 / 0 / 0** with no index pollution. Handwriting is difficult and exact transcription is not treated as strict golden accuracy.
- `Schoen_1983_Uniqueness_Symmetry_Embeddedness_scan.pdf`: 19 image-only pages. Byte-identical strict 180-DPI OCR geometry is rerun through v334 and preserves **0 / 16 / 14**. The retained strict geometry was originally measured at about **1.16 s/page** in the local OCR proxy; this is cache-reuse evidence, not a fresh production-Texify benchmark.
- The local OCR proxy is not the production browser Formula OCR/Texify path. Production OCR should be manually checked when OCR-engine-specific behavior is suspected.

## Breadth / historical corpus note

This regression intentionally expands runnable coverage beyond geometric analysis to combinatorics, calculus/graphs, integration, abstract algebra, engineering mechanics, source-code documents, software architecture/performance, formal proof, functional equations, matrix algebra, functional analysis, and probability/harmonic analysis.

Historical cross-field works were additionally researched for future rotation—Turing (computability), Shannon (information theory), Selberg (number theory), Nash (game theory), Metropolis et al. (Monte Carlo/statistical mechanics), Milnor (topology), Erdős–Rényi (random graphs), Kalman (control/filtering), Kac (spectral geometry), Black–Scholes (mathematical finance), and Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (numerical PDE). Their public PDF bytes were not available to the local detector sandbox in this run, so **they are not counted as tested files**.

## Unresolved / manual checks / future reference

- Handwritten `581 Note 7.pdf` is visually readable to a person but the generic local OCR proxy has weak symbol/text transcription. This does not currently create false Structure/Results/Equations/Bibliography. Production Formula OCR/Texify should be checked manually before treating handwritten transcription accuracy as a product defect.
- Gromov and Pisier still rely on established image-assisted margin evidence for their strict equation totals; the native text layer alone remains incomplete by design. Future rotations should continue to exercise those image-assist paths.
- Browser-only rendering/navigation behavior and production Texify OCR cannot be fully exercised in this sandbox. Detector functions are run from the actual MathReader source against native/OCR line geometry.
- Public historical papers researched above are future candidates, not claimed coverage.
- Rare technical unit strings outside the deliberately narrow measurement-unit guard should only be added if they recur as a class problem; do not broaden the rule speculatively.

## Cleanup / release gates

- Application version: **v335** (v334 detector regression retained; v335 is a targeted export/import portability fix).
- Structure index version: **39** (unchanged).
- Equation summary index version: **20**.
- All JavaScript subsystem files and bootstrap pass `node --check`.
- The only intended detector behavior change is rejection of bare dotted decimal measurements as equation labels.
- Full campaign comparison shows no detector-output changes outside `Fraljiculator_ArrayPool_Architecture_Updated.pdf`, where the single false equation is removed.
- Release ZIP contains only the root `mathreader/` package; no OCR intermediates, harnesses, screenshots, or regression scratch files.
